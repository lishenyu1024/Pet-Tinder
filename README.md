## Architecture and Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Framework:** Angular
  - Creating user interfaces using Angular's two-way data binding and modular development methods.
    
### Backend
- **Language and Framework:** Python & Django
  - Utilize Django's back-end logic and database interaction capabilities.
  - Django interacts with SQLite database to manage user and pet information.

### Database
- **Type:** SQLite
  - Use SQLite database to store user and pet data, including activity information.

## Other Technologies
- Front-end and back-end communication: REST API design pattern, using Django REST framework
- Weather API integration: OpenWeatherMap API
- Authentication and security: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Installation

 - Clone the repository to your local machine.
```rake
git clone https://github.com/lishenyu1024/web.git
```

## Front-end installation preparation
- cd Frontend/pet_frontend
- Install the required packages
```rake
npm install
```
 - Install Angular CLI globally by running the following command:
```rake
npm uninstall -g angular-cli
```
```rake
npm uninstall --save-dev angular-cli
```
```rake
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
- Start the Frontend development server
```rake
ng serve
```
- Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200
  
## Back-end installation preparation
- cd Backend/pet_backend
- Install the required packages
```rake
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
- Set up the database
```rake
python manage.py migrate
```
- If can't set up the database
```rake
python manage.py migrate --fake
```
- Start the Backend development server
```rake
python manage.py runserver
```
